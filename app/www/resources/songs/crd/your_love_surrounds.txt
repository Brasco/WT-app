{t:Your Love Surrounds}
[Dm]I [Bb]love [F]your [C]ways, I seek your face
I see your grace
Feel your embrace

I walk away, so prone to stray
Fell cold and gray
You call my name

{soc}
Your love surrounds me like a sea
I feel your mercy pouring out over me
You lift me up when I fall
You always hear me, hear me when I call
{eoc}

Empty so long, passion so strong
My heart yearns to feel your love so real
